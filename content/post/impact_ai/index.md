AI has aroused both excitement and fear over the past couple of years with everyone trying to predict its effects from either a scientific point or a place of fear…

Trying to predict on the impact of AI on society in the future isn’t an easy task because according to me AI is affected by the society. 

Humans of today are in charge of building AI, and we build from experience, and what we build also changes depending on how these experiences change, e.g Facial Recognition systems were discovered to be biased because of the data sets we used in training the models, and because of that, we tried to improve these data sets by making them more diverse. 

So whether AI will positively or negatively affect the society in the future is fully dependent on our response to its impact on the society today.
