# Hey There!

I'm Martin, a human being 🤖. I love working with Deep Neural Networks.

Currently researching the **Effectiveness of Singing Voice Timbre Transfer for AMT**, and exploring **Open Source** through [HacktoberFest](https://hacktoberfest.com).

This is the second project on AI and Music ([MERA](https://github.com/martinoywa/MERA)) that I'm doing! Guess this might be my thing lol! 😄

Tools: Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, LangChain, and many other DL toolings.
