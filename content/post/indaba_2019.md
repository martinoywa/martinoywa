Today was the last day of the Indaba 2019 at Kenyatta University which began on 25th Aug 2019. So instead of me going through all the knitty gritties of what took place throughout the entire week, I’ll just write about what the Indaba did for my life, and what the Indaba means to me now.

Let’s get to the first part. I’ve always been a guy with really crazy ideas as to what I want to do with any kind of knowledge or information I have, even though, some still can’t be implemented, at least that’s what I thought. Through the Indaba I got a chance to meet people who had crazier ideas, which btw, most were able to completely implement, while others were still being worked on. I got to understand that every idea, no matter how crazy it seems is worth pursing.

The Indaba also gave me a chance to meet people from all sorts of fields, like Engineering, Computer Science, and Medicine, just to mention a few. Also met people at different levels in education who really motivated me and gave me a chance to tell them my story and what I was working on, which to me was a really great deal, to have a voice. Another really great achievement for me, well apart from solving the Zindi Cube Challenge, was that for the first time, I got a chance to be a mentor. As the Indaba was taking place, we also had a hackathon for teens who are into AI(Artificial Intelligence), the IndabaX Teens in AI Africa Hackathon. This program was an opportunity for me to inspire others as I was inspired to make a difference in the community be leveraging various technologies, in this case AI.

Now for the second part. What does the Indaba mean to me now? At the beginning, while I was applying for the Indaba, I thought it was just another global convetion where I get to attend and just listen to talks, but now that I actually got to experience it, the Indaba is far more greater than that. It’s community. A community filled with people from all walks of life, who gather to inspire each other, grow with each other, and share their ideas of how all of us can use AI for the greater good. It’s a safe space for allowing people to find and share their voice.

Our theme this year was SAUTI YETU(OUR VOICE), and for sure, I did, find my voice.

As for the Indaba 2020 Tunisia, I’m on my way! #DLIndaba2019 #SautiYetu
